**Antenna BNC Plug:**

-This CAD project, created in Fusion360, is dedicated to designing a BNC plug for an antenna.

-Its primary purpose is to ensure the dimensions of the plug meet specific requirements, likely for compatibility or functionality with other components of the antenna system.

-The BNC plug is a type of connector commonly used in RF (radio frequency) applications, particularly in antennas and telecommunications equipment.

**Cubic Antenna Model:**

-Another CAD project in Fusion360, this one focuses on simulating the dimensions of a Cubic Antenna.

-The Cubic Antenna is designed for AVIONIX ENGINEERING sp. z o.o.

-This project involves ensuring the dimensions and performance characteristics of the Cubic Antenna meet specific requirements.

**Filter Model:**

-This CAD project, also created in Fusion360, is dedicated to simulating the dimensions of a filter.

-The filter is essential for fitting inside an open-air multirack, again for AVIONIX ENGINEERING sp. z o.o.

-The filter likely serves a specific purpose within the multitrack system, such as signal processing or interference reduction.


**OpenAir Multitrack Testing Shelf:**

-This CAD project, again in Fusion360, involves designing a shelf for testing devices within the open-air multirack system.

-The design emphasizes low material cost and practicability, indicating a focus on efficiency and functionality.

-The shelf is intended to hold and facilitate testing of various components or devices within the open-air multirack system, ensuring ease of access and organization during testing procedures.
