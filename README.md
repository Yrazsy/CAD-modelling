Antenna BNC Plug:
-This CAD project, created in Fusion360, is dedicated to designing a BNC plug for an antenna.
-Its primary purpose is to ensure the dimensions of the plug meet specific requirements, likely for compatibility or functionality with other components of the antenna system.
-The BNC plug is a type of connector commonly used in RF (radio frequency) applications, particularly in antennas and telecommunications equipment.

Cubic Antenna Model:
-Another CAD project in Fusion360, this one focuses on simulating the dimensions of a Cubic Antenna.
-The Cubic Antenna is designed for AVIONIX ENGINEERING sp. z o.o., implying it may be intended for aerospace or engineering applications.
-This project involves ensuring the dimensions, and performance characteristics of the Cubic Antenna meet specific requirements.

Filter Model:
-This CAD project, also created in Fusion360, is dedicated to simulating the dimensions of a filter.
-The filter is essential for fitting inside an openair multirack, again for AVIONIX ENGINEERING sp. z o.o.
-The filter likely serves a specific purpose within the multirack system, such as signal processing or interference reduction.

OpenAir Multitrack Testing Shelf:
-This CAD project, again in Fusion360, involves designing a shelf for testing devices within the openair multirack system.
-The design emphasizes low material cost and practicability, indicating a focus on efficiency and functionality.
-The shelf is intended to hold and facilitate testing of various components or devices within the openair multirack system, ensuring ease of access and organization during testing procedures.
